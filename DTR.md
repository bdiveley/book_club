Template for DTR Memo

Project: Book Club

Group Member Names:  William and Bailey

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
William: practicing solid collaborative workflow (through Waffle); putting everything we've learned so far together into one meaningful project.  Learning the rhythm for a Rails application, driven by TDD.  Doesn't define success by completing the extensions, but would love to work on it if time allows.  Build out wireframes, then build HTML from there.

Bailey: Samesies on exension expectations.  Expectation is to touch everything on the project as much as possible so would prefer to work together whenever possible.  Styling is pretty low on my priority list.  Also interested in practicing Rails and putting together pieces of the app functionality.  

Team strengths?  
William: Ability to look at things at a high strategic level without losing the details, strong planner, articulate, vast knowledge base (Bailey added)

Bailey: organized, hard worker, gets stuff done (task rabbit), prioritizes work life balance, emotionally aware

How to overcome obstacles?
William: meditate, unless there's serious time pressure, doesn't typically get frustated; typically a challenge is more interesting than frustrating

Bailey:  Can be frustrated if a topic is not clicking in my head. I can begin to lose patience when I'm frustrated.  So feel free and be open if/when that comes up, I try to be cognizant of it as well.  

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
We have all day to work on Wednesday and Thursday this week, let's plan to work Saturday as well.
Can stay as late as needed on Mondays.  Take Sunday off.  1-2 hours after class this week

Project: Project Kickoff Saturday morning:
Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):  Since we'll mostluy be working together, we will communicate in those in-person meetings.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):  See above.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): We both want to touch most features to get practice on putting the whole application together through TDD so we'll prioritize working side by side as time allows.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
Waffle will be utilized for project management.  When the other pushes a git branch, the other will review, comment and merge.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: direct feedback is preferred by both.

Agenda to discuss project launch: Review DTR, set up cards in Waffle basedon user stories, set up initial repo and database
